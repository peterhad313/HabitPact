Representative Tasks:

1) Create a new habit - Implemented fully on html,css,javascript
	In this task, the user gets to choose a new habit, set its type, length, and stake ($ to 'invest' initially and get back at end of the pact)
	The task is a simple form. The user has to figure out what to click on and how to determine values for the task. Ideally, this would be done on a touchscreen smartphone, but it can easily be done with a cursor. 
	Once the form is filled out, BEGIN will send the data to the home screen, where the user can see the task he/she just created, along with an empty progress bar showing the days left to complete the task. 
	Since there is no back-end storage of user interaction, any clicks or visits to other pages will result in the new task to be deleted. 

2) View Habit - static implementation
	In this task, the user wants to check on his/her habit to see the progress. 
	This is done by clicking on any of the presently working habits (for our case, just one). The link will show a page with information about the given habit and the progress toward completing it. 

3) Add Progress - static implementation
	In this task, the user wants to log some new progress to a given habit. For example, log a workout for a Fitness-type habit. This is a button within the View Progress page, so the user is aware of the habit he is adding progress to. 
	Depending on the type of habit where progress is being logged, the app would then ask for information (location, pictures, friends' reviews, fitness tracking band synchronization, etc...)
